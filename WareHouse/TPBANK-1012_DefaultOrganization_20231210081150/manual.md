## Main Functions

ChatDev provides a complete front-end and back-end system for building websites. The main functions of our software include:

1. Front-end Development: You can create user interfaces using the tkinter library in Python. The `frontend.py` file contains the front-end logic of the website. You can customize the widgets and their behavior in this file.

2. Back-end Development: The `backend.py` file contains the back-end logic of the website. You can process form data, interact with databases, and perform any required operations in this file.

3. Website Creation: The `main.py` file is the main entry point of the website. It initializes the front-end and back-end components and creates the necessary widgets. You can modify this file to add additional functionality to your website.

4. Form Submission: The website allows users to submit forms. When a form is submitted, the front-end collects the form data and passes it to the back-end for processing. The processed data can be saved to a database or used for any other purpose.
